# CI/CD Pipeline
# 
# This workflow runs tests on all pull requests and releases on pushes to master.
# It's designed to work with branch protection rules that require:
# - Pull requests for all changes to master
# - The "Test" job to pass before merging
# - GitHub Actions to bypass PR requirements for semantic-release
